==================
Here I present a program that implements merge-sort so that the
size of the buffer of the RAM is limited to 50 MB.

For using, make sure output.txt is exist and empty.
For regular sorting, use this parameters:
A inputFile output.txt columnToSort tempPath
For example: A textFile output.txt 2 /Desktop

For selecting (sub-string), use this parameters:
B (or C)  inputFile output.txt columnToSort tempPath columnToSelect subStringToSelect
For example: B textFile output.txt 2 /Desktop 1 ab
